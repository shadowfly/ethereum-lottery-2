# Ethereum Lottery Demo

Yet another prototype of a `Lottery` DApp which is currently just a renamed fork of [SampleCrowdsale.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/examples/SampleCrowdsale.sol) obtained from the examples shared by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) (an ERC20 token template).

To deploy the `Lottery` DApp on a truffle server, do the following:

	git clone https://github.com/strange-labs-uk/ethereum-lottery
	cd ethereum-lottery
	npm install -g truffle
	npm install
	truffle develop

In the `truffle(develop)>` console:

	deploy --reset

Now you can interact with the lottery contract. Lets send an ether to the lottery DApp to buy lottery tokens.
	
	lot = Lottery.deployed()
	lot.then(function(instance){return instance.buyToken(web3.eth.coinbase,{value:1000});})
	lot.then(instance=>instance.weiRaised())

Check the token balance balance:
	
	lot = Lottery.at(Lottery.address)
	ltk = lot.token().then(address=>LotteryToken.at(address))
	ltk.then(instance=>instance.balanceOf(web3.eth.coinbase))

The best thing to do to ensure that the contract is functioning as expected seems to be to build unit tests into `test/Lottery.test.js` and run `test` inside `truffle(develop)>` console.

## Front-end

After you have the truffle contract deployed using the instructions above, now you can use the front-end to interact with functions from the deployed contract using a simple web interface. However, make sure you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) installed on your browser and have added one of the 10 accounts generated by truffle using the respective private key provided.

To serve it:

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start

Then browse to http://localhost:3000.

If you make changes to the contract that you want to propagate to the web interface, reset your deployed contract on the `truffle(develop)>` console and refresh the web page:
    
    deploy --reset
